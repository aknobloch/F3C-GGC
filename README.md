# F3C at GGC
Created March 2017

#### Description
The purpose of the F3C (find free, free chargers) app was to display a list view containing the available electric 
vehicle chargers on the GGC campus lots. The list is updated by making RESTful calls to a public database hosted by 
ChargePoint.com. The list displays the location, time and number of available chargers at that location. When the user 
selects a location, F3C will output more specific information about the location, as well as use a TTS engine to read 
the specific location to the user. These descriptions are given by the database and modified into a more human-friendly
sentence. This app could theoretically be easily extended to accomodate other locations, as well.
